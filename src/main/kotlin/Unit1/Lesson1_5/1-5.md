# Functions

A Function is a block of code that can be called from other places in your code.
Functions are useful for organizing your code and making it more readable.

## Built-In Functions
Kotlin has some built in functions for things like console IO and math.
Here are some examples of built in functions.

```kotlin
println("Hello World") // Prints "Hello World" to the console
val a = readLine() // Reads a line from the console and stores it in a
val b = readLine()?.toInt() // Reads a line from the console and tries to convert it to an integer
val c = Math.pow(2.0, 3.0) // Raises 2 to the power of 3
```

There is also the "Main" function. This is the entry point of your program.
When you run your program, the code inside the main function will be executed.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

## Creating Functions
Declaring, or creating, a function is easy.
You use the fun keyword followed by the name of the function.
Then you put the code you want to run inside curly braces.

```kotlin
fun myFunction() {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

## Parameters
Functions can take parameters.
Parameters are variables that are passed into the function.
You can specify the type of the parameter after the parameter name.

```kotlin
fun myFunction(a: Int, b: Int) {
    println(a + b)
}
```

## Return Types
Functions can also return values.
You specify the return type after the parameter list.
If the function does not return anything, you can use the Unit type.

```kotlin
fun myFunction(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

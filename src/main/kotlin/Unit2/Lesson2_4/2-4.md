# Inheritance

What is inheritance? Inheritance allows you to *inherit* the properties and methods of another class. This is useful when you have a class that is similar to another class, but has some differences. Instead of rewriting the entire class, you can just inherit the class and add the differences.

## Inheriting a class

To inherit a class, you use the `:` operator, and the `open` keyword. For example, if you wanted to inherit the `Person` class, you would do this

```kotlin
open class Person(name: String, age: Int){
    // ...
}

class Student(name: String, age: Int, grade: Int) : Person(name, age){
    // ...
}
```

The `Student` class inherits the `Person` class. The `Student` class has all the properties and methods of the `Person` class. The `Student` class also has the `grade` property.

## Overriding methods

Sometimes, you want to change the behavior of a method. Using the `Person` class from before, you may have a method called `sayHello()`. The `sayHello()` method may print out `"Hello, my name is $name"`. However, you may want to change the behavior of the `sayHello()` method in the `Student` class. You can do this by overriding the method.

```kotlin
open class Person(name: String, age: Int){
    open fun sayHello(){
        println("Hello, my name is $name")
    }
}

class Student(name: String, age: Int, grade: Int) : Person(name, age){
    override fun sayHello(){
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am in grade $grade")
    }
}
```

### Overriding default methods

You can also override default methods. For example, the `toString()` method is a default method. You can override it like this

```kotlin
open class Person(name: String, age: Int){
    override fun toString(): String{
        return "Name: $name, Age: $age"
    }
}
```
